LESS mixins
===========

A collection of mixins for use with LESS. Original constructed for use together with
[Mr. White Angular Generator](https://github.com/Iteam1337/generator-mrwhite), but should
work great with any project!

## Installation
Install it using [Bower](http://bower.io) by running

    bower install mrwhite-less-mixins --save-dev

on your command line.

When the download is done, add `mixins.less` to your project and use the mixins as suggested in the documentation above each mixin.
