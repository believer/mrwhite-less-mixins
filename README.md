LESS mixins
===========

A collection of mixins for use with LESS. Originally constructed for use together with [Mr. White Angular Generator](https://github.com/Iteam1337/generator-mrwhite), but should work great with any project!

## Installation
Install it using [Bower](http://bower.io) by running

    bower install mrwhite-less-mixins --save

on your command line.

When the download is done, import `mixins.less` in to your project and use the mixins as suggested in the documentation above each mixin.
